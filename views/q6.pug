h2 Round 6

p Hmm, we feel that we want better data about who has the treasure at the end.

p In light of this, we will no longer take in the #[code treasureFound] or #[code treasureStolen] attributes in the answer, but expect a #[code treasureOwner] attribute instead!

h3 IMPORTANT: Before staring, don't forget to run #[code #{"./reconnect.sh"}] to pull the latest code from server

p The question server will provide:
  pre
    code.
        {
          startX: ~integer~
          startY: ~integer~
          instructions: ~string~
          treasureX: ~integer~
          treasureY: ~integer~
          pirateX: ~integer~
          pirateY: ~integer~
          spyX: ~integer~
          spyY: ~integer~
        }

p The answer will expect:
  pre
    code.
      {
        endX: ~integer~
        endY: ~integer~
        treasureOwner: "no-one" | "me" | "pirate" | "spy"
      }
