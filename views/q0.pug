h3 Throughout this experiment we are under the retro prime directive. Do not judge the code of others!! Just do the best you can with situation at hand!


p Please download one of the following setup files to help get CodeWhispers setup on your machine

p
  a(href="/teamPack/setup-whisper.bat") Windows
p
  a(href="/setup-whisper.sh") Mac Linux Unix

p It is expected that ruby and git are available from your command line

p Give run permissions to the downloaded script

p To get setup run #[code #{"sh setup-whisper.sh ~YourTeamName~"}]

p #[code cd] into the new folder called #[code ~YourTeamName~]

p Run #[code #{"npm start"}] to try to answer all questions from the server

p Run #[code #{"./reconnect.sh"}] when I tell you to pick up your new branch

p When you are happy that you have fully answered a question... make sure to commit and push you code to my git server.

h3 Git ground rules for this experiment... Do not make any new branches!!! Do not stash!!! Only do basic git add + commit + push

h2 Round 0

p You are an adventurer looking for adventure on an infinite plain.  In this round you are rather lazy and do not move from the spot.

p The question server will provide you with a #[code #{"start"}] value. (integer)

p The answer expects the same value marked as #[code #{"end"}].

p The question server will provide:
  pre
    code.
        {
          start: ~integer~
        }

p The answer will expect:
  pre
    code.
      {
        end: ~integer~
      }

h3 IMPORTANT: When you have completed this round, don't forget to run #[code #{"git push"}]
